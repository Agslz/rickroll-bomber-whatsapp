# Message Automation Script

This JavaScript script allows you to automate the process of sending messages in a web interface, such as a chat conversation in a messaging application. Follow these simple steps to use it:

## Usage Instructions

1. **Copy the Code**: Copy the entire code from the script provided in this repository. You can find the code in the `script.js` file.

2. **Access the Conversation**: Open the conversation or chat in the web interface where you want to send messages.

3. **Open the Browser Console**:
   - In most browsers, you can open the console by pressing `F12` or `Ctrl + Shift + I` (Cmd + Option + I on Mac) and then selecting the "Console" tab in the developer tools window.

4. **Paste the Code in the Console**: Once the console is open, paste the code you copied in step 1 directly into the console.

5. **Press Enter**: After pasting the code, press `Enter` to execute the script.

6. **Message Automation**: The script will start sending messages one after another in the chat's text area. Messages are sent automatically with a short delay between them to simulate a human pace.

   **Note**: You can adjust the typing speed in the script to avoid detection.

7. **Wait for Completion**: Wait for the script to send all the messages. The total number of messages sent will be displayed in the console when it's finished.

8. **Completion**: Once the script has sent all the messages, you'll see a message in the console indicating that the code has completed. You can close the console and continue with your activity in the web interface.

## Example of Use

Here's a simple example of how to use the script in your browser:

1. Open your messaging application and select a conversation in which you want to send messages.

2. Open the browser console.

3. Paste the code in the console and press `Enter`.

4. The script will start sending messages automatically.

5. Wait for the script to finish, and you'll see a message in the console indicating how many messages were sent.

## Notes
